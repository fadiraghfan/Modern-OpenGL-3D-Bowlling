Modern OpenGL project 3D bowlling alley.

When the solution file is ran the user will be met with a simple 3D bowling alley with a sphere at the close end of said alley
(relative to the camera position) and 10 cilinders on the far end of it.

As for the camera, we integrated it at the beggening of the alley and we are free to look anywhere from different directions 
if needed. 
The movement is controled with keyboard inputs (W for forward movement, A and D for Rotating left and right, R and F for 
rotating up and down, S to move back, spacebar for moving up and finally C for moving down).

Also left mouse click launches the ball, and right click resets the ball to inital positon as well as the cilinders to their
inital state (upright).
